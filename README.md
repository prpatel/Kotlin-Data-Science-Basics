Materials in a Zeppelin Notebook format. 

These are the code samples from the presentation given at GSJUG in December 2020. You can view the full video here:

I had to fix the Kotlin interpreter for Zeppelin, to support some of the newer dynamic features of Kotlin to make a couple of the Kotlin data related libs work. 
Put:
zeppelin-kotlin-0.9.0-preview2.jar [LINK TO JAR FILE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16t6tPRCN19wF4XUDpekf69u-L1QpJou1/view?usp=sharing)

into this folder of your Zeppelin installation:
~/dev/zeppelin-0.9.0-preview2-bin-all

That's why I love open source! Clone the repo, patch, rebuild, get it done!

I hope you have fun with it and reach out on twitter (@prpatel) to ask questions!
